# MND_Data_Management

This is a collection of corresponding modules that collect & manipulate client data, 
generating dataframes to populate a series of Excel reports that MND uses to track 
client outcomes, progress toward fulfilling grant project requirements, and employee performance.

This repository also includes Excel files containing dashboards customized for the dataframes 
generated in the python modules.

Lastly the repository contains MND's digital intake packet which serves as the basis of all 
MND client demographic data.
